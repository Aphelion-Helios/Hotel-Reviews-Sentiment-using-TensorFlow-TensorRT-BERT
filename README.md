# Sentiment analysis of hotel reviews with BERT
Using some reviews I scraped and pulled through google translate for an Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) job, this notebook shows how to use a pretrained BERT model from Hugging Face to train a simple sentiment classifier using TensorFlow. The code contains all the necessary lines to use the full BERT model, but are commented out to use distilBERT instead, to speed up the finetuning job.

Looking for an approach using the simple fit command?
